# Learning Rust

This is a Git repository containing my adventures with the Rust programming
language as I learn it myself.

You're free to look at it, but it's not really intended to make sense for anyone
besides me.

## Working with this Repository

Each of the sub-directories represents a "Rust project" complete with its own
`Cargo.toml` file to define things and whatnot. Each one also has its own
`.vscode/` folder that is intended for use with the official [Rust (rls)][vsrust]
plugin.
